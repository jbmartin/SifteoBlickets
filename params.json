You just launched your very own blicket experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n#What are blickets?\r\n\r\nThe word 'blicket' is a neologism (or made up word) created by psychologists. \r\nHowever, to a psychologist or philosopher interested in how people reason and learn about causality, a blicket has the following meaning:\r\n\r\n**blicket** (n. *plural* blickets)\r\n\r\n1. (philosophy) An object with certain properties causing it to trigger a \"blicket detector\" (a device that lights up and plays music), introduced in certain experiments relating to causality and perception ([wikitonary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blicket)).\r\n\r\nIn other words a 'blicket' is basically something that can _cause_ something else (specifically, the 'blicket detector') to do something.\r\nJust like an Aspirin might cause your headache go away, a \"blicket\" might make a \"blicket detector\" go wild (blink and play sounds).\r\nWhy call it a blicket?  Meaningless nonesense words are an important tool for studying learning and reasoning because they help to reduce or remove the influence prior knowledge.\r\nYou could rename a blicket anything (\"wuz\", \"kez\", etc...) but many experiments in causal learning have been done (arbitrarily) with the phrase 'blicket.'\r\n\r\nPsychologists have relied on the blicket detector game as a model of how people learn new causal relationships.\r\nHow does the blicket game work?  Typically in an experiment, the researcher tells the participant that there is a box that is a \"blicket detector\" that will play sounds and light up when a \"blicket\" is placed on top if it.\r\nIn other words, the blicket will _cause_ the blicket detector to activate when the two come into physical contact.\r\nVarious objects (square blocks) are placed on the blicket detector one a time, and only certain ones cause the detector to activate.\r\nThus, the physical collision between the blicket and the detector causes a change of state in the detector.\r\nThe goal is to see how children and adults learn which objects _cause_ the blicket detector to activate.\r\nThis simple game lets you explore include how children and adults generalize from certain objects to other, novel ones.\r\nFor example, do people generalize based on perceptual properties, causal properties, or a mixture of these properties?\r\n\r\n#What are Sifteo Cubes?\r\nSifteo offers a unique gaming platform centered around interactive 1.5 inch cubes each with their own LCD touch screen, motion sensor, accelerometer, and the ability to sense nearby cubes.\r\nBasically, they're like programmable iPod nanos that can touch and talk to one another!\r\nThese feature packed physical computing devices present an exciting opportunity for psychologists to study how people reason and learn through physical interaction between real objects.\r\n\r\n![][sifteo_cubes]\r\n\r\n[sifteo_cubes]: http://www.ufunk.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Sifteo-Cubes.jpg\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to learn more about Sifteo and \"intelligent

Sifteo Cubes to be used in blicket-type experiments.\r\nOne of the cubes acts as the detector and the rest are objects that may or may not work as blickets.\r\nThe blicket detector cube will activate when the right type of other cube comes in contact with the detector cube.\r\nThis project can serve as an example for others interested in using Sifteo cubes in psychological research, or in running new blicket-type experiments!\r\n\r\n\r\n![][blicket_guts]\r\n![][blicket_detector]\r\n\r\n[blicket_guts]: http://depts.washington.edu/idl/images/blicket_internal_bottom.jpg\r\n[blicket_detector]: http://depts.washington.edu/idl/images/Blicket_top.jpg\r\n\r\nWhy Sifteo Blickets?\r\nOur system offers a number of advantages over traditional blicket-style paradigms.\r\nFirst, in the traditional set-up, the experimenter has to find all the parts and build a blicket detector using hot glue gun and a soldering iron (see above photos, [for instructions on building the box see these notes](http://depts.washington.edu/idl/light_detail.htm)).\r\nThis process can be challenging, error-prone, and messy, especially if there's not an electronics expert in the lab.\r\nSecond, relying on an experimenter to appropriately and accurately toggle the blicket detector when the blicket is placed on top introduces experimental design problems.\r\nFor example, a subtle temporal delay or advance between placing the block on the divide and flipping the switch to activate the blicket might influence the learning of the causal relationship (e.g., Lagnado & Sloman, 2004).\r\nAdditionally, the confederate's anticipation of which block to test next might signal to the participant that there's something special about them aside from their ability to activate the detector.\r\nThis issue is sometimes known as [experimenter expectancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect) effects and are often addressed by designs where the experimenter and participant are \"blind\" to which condition they have been assigned.\r\nFinally, a hardwired blicket detector is a fixed, unchangeable device.\r\nAs a result, it is difficult to create more complicated experiments involving other types of causal patterns, interventions, or variable types.\r\n\r\nSifteo Cubes overcome each of the aforementioned limitations.\r\nEach Sifteo Cube has calibrated object detecting sensors, removing any possibility of the experimenter messing up the timing when on block physically hits another one.\r\nSifteo provides an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows the experimenter to program the logic of the experiment and upload it to the cubes beforehand so that both the participant and the confederate are blind to the condition, avoiding any unintentional signaling.\r\nIn addition, the software can be loaded onto the cubes and carried (along with a small battery powered base station) to a testing site without needing a computer nearby.\r\nThe base station can be used to store data files for later analysis (connects using standard USB).\r\nMost importantly, Sifteo provides endless possibilities for creating (and recreating) interesting psychological experiments beyond the blickets design.\r\nThey are particularly well suited for work with young children where using a computer mouse can be a challenge.\r\n\r\nTo begin exploring the utility of the Cubes, we implemented a version of the classic causal learning experiment by Gopnik & Sobel (2000) (i.e., the blicket experiment).\r\n\r\n#The Experiment\r\n\r\nThe 'blickets' game was first used in a study conducted by Gopnik & Sobel (2000).\r\nG&S looked at how the causal properties of objects (e.g., making a blicket detector flash and play music) shape young children's conceptual knowledge.\r\nPreviously, most developmental research focused on how perceptual features (color, shape, etc.) influence categorization.\r\nThis was motivated by many prominent psychologist, including Piaget, who argued that young children were unable to understand, and therefore, categorize objects based on causal properties.\r\nTo test this theory, G&S pitted perceptual features against causal ones in a simple, yet elegant, category learning paradigm.\r\n\r\n##Materials\r\n\r\nGopnik and Sobel constructed seven sets of four objects out of wooden blocks.\r\nBelow is our attempt to recreate those objects using Adobe Illustrator.\r\nThese materials are freely available in the [asset folder](https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/tree/master/assets) of this git

children.\r\nSet 1 was always presented first, followed by sets 2 through 7 at random.\r\nIn sets 1 through 4, two objects were randomly assigned to be \"blickets\" in the sense that they would activate the \"blicket detector.\"\r\nIn sets 5 and 6, two perceptually conflicting blickets were chosen to be blickets.\r\nIn set 5, for example, one blicket might be the green rounded rectangle and the other blicket might be a red rounded rectangle.\r\nEach child was placed either in a \"induction\" or \"categorization\" condition.\r\nIn the categorization condition, the experimenter placed each of the 4 objects on the blicket detector separately and then returned them to their original spots.\r\nThe experimenter then lifted up one of the blickets and asked the child which of the other blocks was also a blicket.\r\nIn the induction condition, the experimenter described two objects as being blickets and two as not being blickets. She then placed the blicket on the detector and asked the child which of the remaining blocks would also set off the detector.\r\n\r\nJAY:  I THINK A PARAGRAPH HERE ABOUT WHAT THE STUDY FOUND, HOW IT DECONFOUNDS FEATURE/CAUSAL LEARNING WOULD MAKE SENSE.\r\n\r\n![][screen_shot]\r\n\r\n[screen_shot]: https://github.com/jbmartin/SifteoBlickets/blob/master/blog_assets/screen_shot.png?raw=true\r\n\r\n\r\n#Under the hood: Into the darkness known as C++\r\nOkay, so that was pretty cool, but you probabily want to be able to design your _own_  blicket experiment.\r\nSifteo uses a popular programming language called C++.\r\nI'm not going lie, C++ isn't a great language to learn if you're just starting out.\r\nIt's very unforgiving of mistakes and requires quite a bit of knowledge to things that are trivial in scripting languages (Python, Javascript, etc.).\r\nIt's mainly shines in large scale production software suits like operating systems or video games where speed and memory are critical (e.g., tiny game cubes with limited memory and large cpu demands).\r\nFortunately, the Sifteo API wraps up most of the scary parts of dealing with C++ directly.\r\nHowever, it still rears its ugly head from time to time.\r\nWe'll do our best to help you figure out how to deal with it or where to turn go when you're stuck.\r\n\r\nFirst, lets look at the basic logic of main.cpp.\r\n\r\nTodo(Jay):\r\nDiscuss\r\n- [ ] neighborhoods\r\n- [ ] touch events\r\n- [ ] callbacks\r\n- [ ] sprites\r\n- [ ] audio\r\n\r\n\r\n#Advanced\r\n## Interventions (touch screen + neighborhoods)\r\n## Continuous causal power (tilt)\r\n\r\n##Additional resources\r\n* [Getting Oriented with the Sifteo SDK](http://tech.sifteo.com/2013/01/08/getting-oriented-with-the-sifteo-sdk/)\r\n* [Getting Started: Basic Animation](http://tech.sifteo.com/2013/01/22/getting-started-basic-animation/)\r\n* [Neighborhoods and Locality](http://tech.sifteo.com/2013/01/03/neighborhoods-and-locality/)\r\n* [C++ basics](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
